Title: Whole Genome Pair-Wise Alignment Noiser
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Bradford", "Condon", email = "bradford.condon@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package deals with pairwise distance matrices created by pairwise whole-genome alignment.  Because traditional bootstrapping methods do not work for trees created via this method, this package employs an alternative method to assign confidence values to tree nodes.
